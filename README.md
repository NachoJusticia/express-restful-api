## Features
* **Registration/Login**. There are four types of authentication methods implemented:
    * With email: uses the [email-verification](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-verification) library.
    * Facebook: [passport-facebook](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-facebook).
    * Google: [passport-google](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth2).
    * Twitter: [passport-twitter](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-twitter).
> Note that Facebook, Google and Twitter registration/login processes uses [passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport).
* **Authentication**: JSON Web Token.
* **Data validation**: all the database collections have their corresponding [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com) schema in a *models* module.
* **Good code styling**: [eslint](https://eslint.org) and [eslint-plugin-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-node) are included.
* **Changelog**: automatic features and bugfixes tracking in a [changelog](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-conventional-changelog) file.
